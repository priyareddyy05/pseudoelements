            Netflix initially both sold and rented DVDs by mail, but the sales were eliminated within a year to focus on
            the DVD rental business.[13][14] In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming media and video on demand. The
            company expanded to Canada in 2010, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2011, the service began
            to acquire and produce original content, beginning with the political drama House of Cards. By 2022,
            original productions accounted for half of Netflix's library in the United States, and the company had
            ventured into other categories, such as video game publishing via the Netflix service.</p>
